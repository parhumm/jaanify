# Tone-of-Voice Guidelines

> Last updated: {auto-generated by skill}

## Brand Voice

**Overall Tone**: Professional & Friendly

Consistent personality across all content—doesn't change with context.

**Voice Characteristics**:
- **Clear**: Simple language, no jargon
- **Helpful**: Guide users to success
- **Respectful**: Never blame users for errors
- **Human**: Conversational, not robotic

## Tone Characteristics

| Aspect | Guideline | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Formality** | Semi-formal (use "you", avoid jargon) | "Enter your email" not "Please input your electronic mail address" |
| **Warmth** | Approachable, not overly casual | "Welcome aboard!" not "Yo, you're in!" |
| **Directness** | Clear and specific, avoid vagueness | "Email address is required" not "Something is missing" |
| **Emotion** | Empathetic in errors, celebratory in success | Error: "We couldn't find that email" Success: "Email verified!" |

## Language-Specific Formality

Different languages have different pronoun systems for formal/informal address:

| Language | Formal Pronoun | Informal Pronoun | Context | Use in UI |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------|-----------|
| **Persian** | شما (shomā) | تو (to) | Banking, B2B, enterprise | Formal (شما) |
| **Russian** | Вы (Vy) | ты (ty) | Professional UI | Formal (Вы) |
| **German** | Sie | du | Professional / consumer brands | Context-dependent (Sie for B2B, du for consumer) |
| **Turkish** | Siz | sen | Professional / youth apps | Context-dependent (Siz for B2B, sen for youth) |
| **French** | Vous | tu | Professional / consumer apps | Context-dependent (Vous for B2B, tu for consumer) |

**Default recommendation**: Use formal pronouns unless your brand is explicitly casual/youth-focused.

## Error Message Tone

**4-element structure**:
1. **What happened** - Describe the problem
2. **Why it happened** (optional) - If helpful for user understanding
3. **How to fix it** - Clear recovery instructions
4. **What to do next** (optional) - Next steps

**Guidelines**:
- ✓ Take responsibility ("We couldn't process your request" not "You entered invalid data")
- ✓ Be specific ("Email address is required" not "Invalid input")
- ✓ Provide recovery ("Check for typos or try another email")
- ✓ Keep to 7-8th grade reading level
- ✗ Never blame the user
- ✗ Avoid technical jargon ("server error 500")
- ✗ Don't be vague ("Something went wrong")

**Examples**:

| ✓ Good | ✗ Bad |
|--------|-------|
| "We couldn't find that email address. Check for typos or try another email." | "Invalid email." |
| "Password must be at least 8 characters with numbers and symbols. Please update your password." | "Password too weak." |
| "Connection lost. Check your internet connection and try again." | "Network error." |

**Language-specific notes**:
- **Persian**: Warm, formal, "لطفاً" (please) commonly used
- **Russian**: Direct, factual, minimal apologies—focus on solution
- **German**: Precise, non-blaming, constructive
- **French**: Polite, apologetic conditional ("Nous n'avons pas pu...")

## Success Message Tone

**2-element structure**:
1. **Celebrate** - Acknowledge accomplishment (minimal)
2. **Confirm** - What happened

**Guidelines**:
- ✓ Be brief (3-6 words ideal)
- ✓ Use active voice
- ✓ Confirm the action
- ✗ Don't overdo celebration
- ✗ Avoid emojis in serious contexts

**Examples**:

| ✓ Good | ✗ Bad |
|--------|-------|
| "Email verified! Welcome aboard." | "🎉 Woohoo! Your email has been successfully verified by our system!" |
| "Changes saved." | "We saved your changes." |
| "Message sent." | "Your message was sent successfully." |

## Empty State Tone

**3-part structure**:
1. **Headline** - What's missing
2. **Motivation** - Why it matters / how to start
3. **CTA** - Clear action button

**Guidelines**:
- ✓ Be motivating, not punishing
- ✓ Guide user to first action
- ✓ Keep headline short (3-5 words)
- ✗ Don't make user feel bad

**Examples**:

| ✓ Good | ✗ Bad |
|--------|-------|
| **Headline**: "No projects yet"<br>**Motivation**: "Create your first project to get started"<br>**CTA**: "Create project" | **Headline**: "You have no projects"<br>**Motivation**: "You haven't created anything yet"<br>**CTA**: "Click here" |

## Confirmation Dialog Tone

**For destructive actions**:
- ✓ Clearly state the consequence
- ✓ Be specific about what will be deleted/removed
- ✓ Mention if action is irreversible
- ✗ Don't be overly dramatic

**Examples**:

| ✓ Good | ✗ Bad |
|--------|-------|
| "Delete this item? This action cannot be undone." | "Are you absolutely sure you want to delete?" |
| "Remove Sarah from the team? She will lose access to all projects." | "Remove user?" |

## Button & Label Tone

**Guidelines**:
- ✓ Use action verbs (Save, Delete, Send)
- ✓ Be specific (Save changes, Delete item)
- ✓ Keep to 1-3 words
- ✗ Don't use generic "OK" / "Submit"
- ✗ Avoid "Click here"

**Examples**:

| Context | ✓ Good | ✗ Bad |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Save form | "Save changes" | "OK" |
| Delete item | "Delete item" | "Confirm" |
| Send message | "Send message" | "Submit" |
| Cancel action | "Cancel" | "No" |

## Sample Microcopy (Tone Examples)

### Labels
- ✓ "Save changes" - Clear, direct
- ✓ "Email address" - Specific
- ✗ "Input" - Too generic

### Error Messages
- ✓ "Email address is required. Please enter your email to continue." - What + how to fix
- ✗ "Invalid input." - Vague, no recovery

### Success Messages
- ✓ "Email verified! Welcome aboard." - Brief, celebratory
- ✗ "Your email address has been successfully verified." - Too formal, wordy

### Confirmations
- ✓ "Delete this item? This action cannot be undone." - Clear consequence
- ✗ "Are you sure?" - Vague

### Empty States
- ✓ "No messages yet" + "Start a conversation to connect with your team" + "Send message" - Motivating
- ✗ "No data" - Not helpful
