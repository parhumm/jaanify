## Executive Summary

{{executive_summary}}

---

## Scope and Methodology

**Target**: {{repo_name}} @ `{{commit_hash}}`
**Branch**: {{branch}}
**Framework**: {{framework}}
**Routes mapped**: {{routes_count}}

### Methodology

- Framework-specific route/screen extraction
- Navigation pattern analysis for flow mapping
- Nielsen's 10 heuristics assessment from code signals
- Pain-point detection from error/loading/empty state patterns
- Accessibility signal scanning (repo-level only)
- Persona and JTBD inference from route structure

### Scope Limitations

- Personas and JTBD are **inferred from code**, not validated user research
- Accessibility findings are scoped to **repo evidence only** (no runtime behavior)
- Visual aesthetics cannot be assessed from code alone
