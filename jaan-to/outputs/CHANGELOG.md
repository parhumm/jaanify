## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- Generate production-ready backend scaffold with Fastify v5, Prisma v6, Zod validation, JWT auth middleware, RFC 9457 error handling, and 21 route handlers covering all API endpoints
- Generate production-ready frontend scaffold with React 19, Next.js 15 (App Router), TailwindCSS v4 (CSS-first config), 26 components across atomic design levels, 20 TanStack Query v5 hooks, and 4 Zustand v5 stores
- Create 3 interactive design components — dashboard, task input, and onboarding screens — with responsive layouts, dark mode support, and WCAG AA accessibility patterns
- Define OpenAPI 3.1 API contract with 21 endpoints, request/response schemas, RFC 9457 error responses, and JWT + OAuth2 Google security schemes
- Define PostgreSQL data model with 7 tables (User, Task, DailyPlan, DailyPlanSlot, Feedback, GuestSession, RefreshToken), constraints, indexes, and retention policies
- Create Jaanify MVP Product Requirements Document with 7 user stories, acceptance criteria, success metrics, and phased release plan
- Break down backend into 28 development tasks with dependency graph, reliability patterns, and error taxonomy
- Break down frontend into 68 development tasks across 26 components with state matrices, accessibility requirements, and effort estimates
- Generate BDD/Gherkin test cases for 7 core user flows including task creation, AI parsing, daily plan generation, and onboarding
- Generate GTM dataLayer tracking specification with custom events for task lifecycle, AI interactions, and conversion funnel
- Generate multi-language microcopy pack for dashboard, task input, and onboarding screens with cultural adaptation
- Conduct predictive UX audit via heatmap analysis identifying attention patterns and interaction friction across core screens
- Synthesize market research into UX insights covering AI task management competitive landscape and user expectations
- Detect and document full tech stack (Node.js 22, Fastify v5, React 19, Next.js 15, PostgreSQL 16, TailwindCSS v4)

### Changed

- Run engineering audit (detect-dev light mode) on scaffold outputs identifying 11 findings: 1 critical (JWT signature bypass), 2 high (missing rate limiting, localStorage token storage), 3 medium, 3 low, 2 informational — score 6.1/10
- Consolidate detect outputs into knowledge pack (detect-pack light mode) with risk heatmap across 5 domains (1/5 analyzed)

## User Impact Notes

### High Impact

- Backend and frontend scaffolds provide the first runnable code for Jaanify — the project transitions from 100% specification to ~25% implementation
- Critical security finding (E-DEV-001): JWT decode without signature verification must be remediated before any deployment

### Medium Impact

- All 21 API endpoints now have typed route handlers, validation schemas, and service layer stubs
- 26 React components with Server/Client boundary strategy, accessibility patterns, and design token integration
- Engineering audit provides prioritized remediation roadmap for scaffold hardening

### Low Impact

- Design token system (OKLCH colors, DM Sans typography) established for consistent UI
- Test infrastructure configured but no test stubs generated yet

---

## Support Guidance

### Known Issues

- JWT auth middleware decodes tokens without cryptographic verification (E-DEV-001 — Critical)
- No rate limiting on any endpoint (E-DEV-002 — High)
- Access tokens stored in localStorage, vulnerable to XSS (E-DEV-003 — High)
- No CSRF protection on mutation endpoints (E-DEV-005 — Medium)
- No test files generated despite Vitest configured in both scaffolds (E-DEV-008 — Low)

### Migration Steps

- This is the initial release — no migration needed
- Copy scaffold files to project directory and run `pnpm install`
- Configure `.env` / `.env.local` with database URL, JWT secret, Google OAuth credentials

### Suggested Help Articles

- Getting started with Jaanify development environment
- Understanding the backend scaffold architecture (routes, services, schemas)
- Understanding the frontend scaffold architecture (components, hooks, stores)
- Security hardening checklist for scaffold code
