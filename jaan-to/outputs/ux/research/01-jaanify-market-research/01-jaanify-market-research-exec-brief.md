# Jaanify AI Task Management Market Research — Executive Brief

> "84% of consumers would have more trust in AI that demonstrates explainability." — RWS Research, 14 global markets, 2025

## Highlights

- **Zero competition in transparent AI reasoning** — All 10 surveyed competitors operate as Autopilot or Copilot without showing reasoning. Jaanify's "Transparent Copilot" position is unoccupied.
- **Strong demand signal** — Users who rate AI as transparent are 8.5x more likely to trust the brand. 84% of consumers actively want explainable AI.
- **High-pain target segments identified** — 366M neurodivergent adults (very low satisfaction) + 41.8M US freelancers (growing to 50.9% of workforce by 2027) both directly benefit from visible AI reasoning.

## Lowlights

1. **Transparency paradox** — Too much reasoning *reduces* trust. Progressive disclosure (simple default, detail on demand) is architecturally required.
2. **9.63% Day 30 retention** — Productivity apps face catastrophic churn. If onboarding takes >60 seconds, features won't matter.
3. **AI trust declining** — Willingness to trust AI dropped from 61% → 46% in 3 years. Transparency isn't optional — it's survival.
4. **No voice+AI precedent** — Jaanify must pioneer multimodal voice+AI interaction patterns without existing UX references.

## Next Steps

- **Design 3-tier Reasoning Card** — One-line default → factor weights on tap → full chain on demand. A/B test Tier 1 format in first 2 weeks. — Big Bet
- **Achieve first AI task in <30s** — No splash screen, no account. Input field → AI enrichment → Reasoning Card → soft account prompt. — Big Bet
- **Design for ADHD first** — Focus Mode, visual timelines, opt-in gentle nudges, color+text priority indicators. — Quick Win
- **Claim "Transparent Copilot" positioning** — Lead all marketing with "shows its work." First-mover window won't stay open. — Quick Win
- **Prototype voice flow before building** — Test multimodal voice+AI with 3-5 target users. Validate uncharted UX. — Quick Win
