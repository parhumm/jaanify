## Overview

| Generated | 2026-02-07 |

The dashboard is Jaanify's primary screen after onboarding. It shows the AI-generated daily plan with transparent reasoning for task order, productivity stats at a glance, and the task list with expandable Reasoning Cards. Implements PRD user stories US-02 (Transparent AI Daily Plan) and US-06 (Task Prioritization with Visible Factors).

## Design Rationale

### Aesthetic Choices

- **Warm sage green** (#6B8F71) as primary — calming, associated with growth and trust
- **Soft cream background** (#FAF8F5) — reduced eye strain vs pure white
- **Terracotta accent** (#C4836A) — warm urgency indicator without aggressive red
- **DM Sans typeface** — humanist proportions, distinctive yet highly readable
- **Generous whitespace** — every element has breathing room, reducing cognitive load

**Why these choices?**
Neurodivergent users (especially ADHD) benefit from reduced visual clutter and warm color temperatures. The sage/cream palette creates trust without the clinical feel of blue/gray enterprise interfaces. Each UI element earns its space — no decorative clutter.

**Differentiation from generic patterns:**
No purple gradients, no Inter font, no card-heavy dashboard with dense information grids. Instead: a single-column focused flow that respects the user's attention as a scarce resource.

### Technical Approach

- **Layout**: Single-column flex, max-width 480px mobile, scales to 720px desktop
- **Typography**: DM Sans with clamp() fluid scaling, rem units throughout
- **Color**: CSS custom properties with dark mode via prefers-color-scheme
- **Motion**: 150-200ms ease-out transitions, prefers-reduced-motion respected
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first (360px+), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```html
<!-- Open preview file directly in browser -->
open 01-component-preview-jaanify-dashboard.html
```

### For React Implementation

The design tokens (CSS custom properties) map directly to TailwindCSS v4 theme configuration. Component structure maps to:

```
JaanifyDashboard/
├── DashboardHeader       (greeting, date)
├── StatsRow              (tasks, focus, streak)
├── DailyPlan             (AI plan summary + reasoning)
├── TaskList/
│   ├── TaskCard          (task + Tier 1 reasoning)
│   │   └── ReasoningT2   (expandable factor weights)
│   └── AddTaskButton
└── VoiceFAB              (floating mic button)
```

### Props API

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| userName | string | User's first name for greeting |
| tasks | Task[] | Today's tasks with AI metadata |
| dailyPlan | DailyPlan | AI-generated plan with reasoning |
| stats | DashboardStats | Productivity summary data |
| onTaskComplete | (id) => void | Task completion handler |
| onOverride | (id, reason) => void | AI recommendation override |
| onVoiceCapture | () => void | Voice FAB press handler |

## Code

See `01-component-preview-jaanify-dashboard.html` for full implementation.

### Key Highlights

- Checkbox interactions with visual completion feedback
- Voice capture FAB with hover/focus/active states

## Accessibility

**WCAG Compliance**: AA

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Keyboard Navigation | Tab through tasks, Enter/Space to expand reasoning, checkbox focusable |
| Screen Reader | ARIA labels on all interactive elements, sr-only status region |
| Color Contrast | 4.5:1+ for all text, 3:1+ for UI elements |
| Focus Indicators | Custom shadow-based focus ring (not outline:none) |
| Reduced Motion | prefers-reduced-motion disables all transitions |
| Semantic HTML | article, section, header, h1-h3, role="list", role="listitem" |

---

## Responsive Behavior

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Mobile (<640px) | Single column, max-width 480px, compact stats row |
| Tablet (640-1024px) | Max-width 640px, increased padding |
| Desktop (>1024px) | Max-width 720px, larger stat cards, more breathing room |

---

## Customization

### CSS Variables

```css
/* Override any token to re-theme */
:root {
  --color-primary: #6B8F71;      /* Sage green */
  --color-accent: #C4836A;       /* Terracotta */
  --color-bg: #FAF8F5;           /* Warm cream */
  --color-surface: #FFFFFF;       /* Card backgrounds */
  --font-family: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;
  --radius-md: 0.75rem;          /* Card corners */
  --space-lg: 1rem;              /* Base spacing */
}
```

### Theme Variants

Dark mode activates automatically via `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query. All color tokens have dark equivalents defined in the CSS.
