## Executive Summary

Natural language task input component with real-time AI parsing preview. Users type or speak naturally, and the AI extracts title, deadline, category, priority, and subtasks — displayed as an enriched visual card with parsing reasoning. Reuses Jaanify's warm sage/cream design tokens.

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Component | `JaanifyTaskInput` |
| Framework | Standalone HTML/CSS/JS (design preview for React v19) |
| Styling | CSS Custom Properties (shared with dashboard) |
| Type | Input form with live AI preview |
| Design Direction | Warm & Trustworthy |
| Generated | 2026-02-07 |

Implements PRD user story US-01 (Natural Language Task Creation). The component is a full-screen input experience where the text field is prominent, AI parsing happens in real-time (simulated at 600ms debounce), and the enriched result appears as a card below with editable fields and parsing reasoning.

---

## Design Rationale

### Aesthetic Choices

- **Large, borderless input** — Bottom-line only, feels like writing on paper, not filling a form
- **Suggestion chips** — Warm rounded pills for quick-start patterns (Call, Remind, Review, Buy)
- **Parsed result card** — Slides up smoothly with icon-led metadata rows
- **Inline edit buttons** — Pencil icons on each parsed field for quick correction
- **Parsing reasoning** — Keyword highlights in sage chips show what AI detected and why

**Why these choices?**
The input experience must feel instant and delightful — no friction between thought and capture. The large text area with minimal chrome removes the "form filling" anxiety. Parsed results appear as confirmation, not interrogation. Edit buttons on each field give users control without requiring it.

**Differentiation from generic patterns:**
No multi-step form wizard, no dropdown selectors, no rigid fields. Instead: write naturally, see AI magic happen, confirm or tweak. The parsing reasoning prevents the "black box" feeling that kills trust.

### Technical Approach

- **Layout**: Single-column flex, textarea auto-resizes to content
- **Typography**: DM Sans, large input (xl size) for primary focus
- **Color**: Same design tokens as dashboard — sage, cream, terracotta
- **Motion**: 600ms parse debounce, result slides up (300ms ease-out), staggered actions
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first 480px, expands to 640px on desktop

## Usage

### For React Implementation

```
JaanifyTaskInput/
├── TaskInputHeader      (back nav, title)
├── SuggestionChips      (quick-start pills)
├── InputArea/
│   ├── TextArea         (auto-resize, debounced parse trigger)
│   └── VoiceButton      (mic toggle with pulse animation)
├── ParsingIndicator     (dot animation while AI works)
├── ParsedResult/
│   ├── ParsedField      (icon + label + value + edit button) ×4
│   └── ParsingReasoning (keyword highlights showing parse logic)
└── ActionButtons        (Cancel / Save Task)
```

### Props API

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| onSave | (task: ParsedTask) => void | Save handler with enriched task data |
| onCancel | () => void | Cancel handler (return to dashboard) |
| onVoiceStart | () => void | Trigger Web Speech API |
| initialText | string? | Pre-fill text (from "What's on your mind?") |
| suggestions | string[] | Quick-start chip labels |
| parseDelay | number | Debounce ms before AI parse (default: 600) |

## Accessibility

**WCAG Compliance**: AA

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Keyboard Navigation | Tab through chips/input/voice/fields/buttons, Enter to save |
| Screen Reader | aria-live on parsed result, status announcements for parsing/save |
| Color Contrast | 4.5:1+ for all text on cream/white backgrounds |
| Focus Indicators | Custom shadow-based focus ring on all interactive elements |
| Reduced Motion | prefers-reduced-motion disables all animations |
| Semantic HTML | textarea, button, heading hierarchy, role="list" for chips |

---

## Responsive Behavior

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Mobile (<640px) | Full-width 480px, compact chip row, stacked layout |
| Tablet (640-1024px) | 560px container, more padding |
| Desktop (>1024px) | 640px container, vertically centered with top padding |

---

## Customization

### CSS Variables

Shares all tokens with the dashboard component. Key ones for this component:

```css
:root {
  --color-accent-light: #F0DDD5;  /* Deadline icon background */
  --color-primary-subtle: #E8F0E9; /* Category icon + keyword chips */
  --font-size-xl: clamp(1.25rem, 1.15rem + 0.5vw, 1.5rem); /* Input text size */
}
```
