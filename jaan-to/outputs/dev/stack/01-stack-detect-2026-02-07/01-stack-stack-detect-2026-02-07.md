## Executive Summary

The project currently consists of jaan-to plugin workspace files (outputs, context, templates, learn files) and a git submodule. The planned tech stack is fully documented in `tech.md` and confirmed as the target architecture.

- [ ] Fill Communication channels in integrations.md
- [ ] Fill Analytics tools in integrations.md (PostHog planned per PRD)
- [ ] Fill Design Tools in integrations.md
- [ ] Re-run stack-detect after initial codebase is created
