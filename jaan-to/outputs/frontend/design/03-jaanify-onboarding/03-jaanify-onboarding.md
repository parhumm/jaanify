## Executive Summary

Four-step onboarding flow implementing the "Value Before Setup" pattern. Opens directly to task input (no splash screen), shows AI enrichment with Reasoning Card as the "aha" moment, previews the daily plan, then offers a soft account prompt. Designed to complete in under 60 seconds.

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Component | `JaanifyOnboarding` |
| Framework | Standalone HTML/CSS/JS (design preview for React v19) |
| Styling | CSS Custom Properties (shared with dashboard + task input) |
| Type | Multi-step onboarding flow |
| Design Direction | Warm & Trustworthy |
| Generated | 2026-02-07 |

Implements PRD user story US-04 (60-Second Onboarding). The flow has 4 steps:

1. **"What's on your mind?"** — Single input, no friction, autofocused
2. **AI Enrichment** — Shows parsed task with Reasoning Card (the trust moment)
3. **Daily Plan Preview** — Demonstrates the Transparent Copilot value
4. **Soft Account Prompt** — Google OAuth or skip (not blocking)

---

## Design Rationale

### Aesthetic Choices

- **Vertically centered Step 1** — The input floats in calm space, inviting without overwhelming
- **Progressive revelation** — Each step reveals one layer of Jaanify's value
- **The Reasoning Card as "aha" moment** — Step 2 is the key: the user sees WHY the AI made decisions, building immediate trust
- **Non-blocking account prompt** — "Skip for now" is visible and guilt-free
- **Progress dots** — Minimal capsule indicator, active dot extends to show progress

**Why these choices?**
Research shows 60-second onboarding outperforms tutorials. The user types one task and immediately experiences the Transparent Copilot pattern. The Reasoning Card in Step 2 is the product's core differentiator — showing it in onboarding sets expectations and builds trust from the first interaction.

**Differentiation from generic patterns:**
No carousel tutorial, no permission-begging, no feature tour. The user DOES the core action first, then sees value, then decides to commit. The "skip" option is a real button, not hidden small text.

### Technical Approach

- **Layout**: Flex column, step-based visibility with CSS transitions
- **Typography**: DM Sans, large 3xl title for welcome, generous line height
- **Color**: Same design tokens as dashboard and task input
- **Motion**: 500ms cubic-bezier entrance (smooth deceleration), progress dot animation
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first 480px, scales to 560px on desktop
