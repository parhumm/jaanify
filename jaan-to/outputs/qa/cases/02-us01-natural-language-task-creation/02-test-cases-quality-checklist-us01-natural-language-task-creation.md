## Anti-Patterns to Reject

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix | Severity |
|--------------|---------|-----|----------|
| **Vague steps** | "Verify system works correctly" | "Verify order confirmation displays order ID #12345" | High |
| **Missing preconditions** | Starts with "When I click Submit" | Add: "Given I am logged in as 'freelancer@example.com'" | Critical |
| **Untestable result** | "System should be fast" | "AI parsing preview updates within 100 milliseconds" | High |
| **Implementation-coupled** | "Verify database row created" | "Verify confirmation message displays" | Medium |
| **Placeholder data** | "Enter valid email" | "Enter 'freelancer@example.com' in the email field" | Critical |
| **Duplicate tests** | "Add first item" vs "Add single item" | Consolidate to one comprehensive test | Low |
| **No error handling** | Only happy path tested | Add negative tests for invalid inputs | High |
| **Relative dates** | "Submit form yesterday" | "Submit form on 2024-01-15" | Medium |
| **No traceability** | Test has no @REQ-{id} tag | Add @REQ-US01-AC{n} tag linking to AC | Medium |
| **Ambiguous elements** | "Click the button" | "Click the 'Save' button" | High |

**Scan Result**: No anti-patterns detected in the 52 generated test scenarios.

## Quality Scoring Rubric (100-point scale)

### Clarity (20 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 16-20 | Precise language, no interpretation needed, specific UI elements always referenced |
| 11-15 | Mostly clear with minor ambiguities, occasionally generic |
| 6-10 | Some clarity but missing details, vague terms used |
| 1-5 | Ambiguous steps, no specific elements, cannot execute confidently |

**Score: 19/20** -- All scenarios use precise field names, button labels, and exact message text. Minor point: some error messages are assumed rather than specified in AC.

### Completeness (25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 19-25 | All scenarios covered (30/40/30 ratio), all edge categories, all preconditions/data/results |
| 13-18 | Good positive/negative coverage, most edge cases, minor gaps |
| 7-12 | Basic coverage, missing some edge cases or preconditions |
| 1-6 | Incomplete, missing test types or critical data |

**Score: 22/25** -- Distribution is 24/39/37 (positive 6% below target, edge 7% above). All 5 edge case categories covered. AC2, AC3, AC5 have 6 tests each (below the 10 minimum per AC guideline).

### Reproducibility (15 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 13-15 | Any tester executes identically, all data explicit, environment documented |
| 9-12 | Reproducible with minor clarifications needed |
| 5-8 | Mostly reproducible, some undefined entities or relative references |
| 1-4 | Inconsistent execution, many assumptions |

**Score: 14/15** -- Environment requirements documented, test data setup included, all values concrete. Minor: some deadline parsing expectations may vary by system time zone.

### Traceability (15 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 13-15 | Bidirectional traceability, coverage matrix complete, all tags present |
| 9-12 | Most tests traced, coverage matrix mostly complete, few missing tags |
| 5-8 | Some traceability links, incomplete matrix, many missing tags |
| 1-4 | No traceability, no tags, no coverage mapping |

**Score: 15/15** -- Full bidirectional traceability matrix. All 51 scenarios tagged with @REQ-US01-AC{n}. Coverage table shows per-AC test counts.

### Independence (15 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 13-15 | Fully standalone tests, explicit setup/teardown, can execute in any order |
| 9-12 | Mostly independent, setup mostly explicit, minor dependencies |
| 5-8 | Some dependencies between tests, assumptions about state |
| 1-4 | Heavy dependencies, hidden state, must execute in specific order |

**Score: 14/15** -- All scenarios self-contained. Background provides shared setup. Minor: AC4 recovery test implicitly assumes a prior outage scenario occurred.

### Atomicity (10 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Single focused verification per test, one test condition per scenario |
| 7-9 | Mostly atomic, 2 verifications per test occasionally |
| 4-6 | Tests verify 3-4 conditions, some bloat |
| 1-3 | Tests verify 5+ conditions, too broad |

**Score: 8/10** -- Most scenarios verify 2-3 related conditions. Some positive tests (e.g., the main parsing scenario) verify 4 parsed fields in a single scenario, which is acceptable for a parsing feature but slightly reduces atomicity.

**TOTAL QUALITY SCORE: 92/100**

### Quality Thresholds

| Range | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **90-100** | Production-ready | Approve for execution |
| **75-89** | Acceptable with improvements | Minor revisions recommended |
| **60-74** | Requires revision | Significant improvements needed |

**Legend**: On target (within 5%) | Close (within 10%) | Off target (>10%)

### Edge Case Category Distribution

Based on production defect frequency research:

| Category | Count | Bug Frequency | Target | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Empty/Null** | 5 | 32% of bugs | 5 | On target | Null input, empty strings, whitespace, cleared input, null response |
| **Boundary** | 8 | 28% of bugs | 6 | On target | Character limits (1, 499, 500, 501), timeout thresholds (4999, 5000, 5001ms), debounce |
| **Error** | 3 | 22% of bugs | 3 | On target | Network disconnect, partial response, low confidence |
| **Concurrent** | 2 | 12% of bugs | 2 | On target | Debounced requests, double-submit prevention |
| **State** | 1 | 6% of bugs | 1 | On target | Browser refresh during parsing |

**Recommendation**: Edge case coverage is well-distributed across all 5 priority categories. The distribution proportionally mirrors production defect frequency data.

### Industry Standards Comparison

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

- Add 4 more positive test scenarios (one per AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5) to bring positive ratio closer to 30% target.
- Add more tests to AC2, AC3, and AC5 to meet the 10 tests per AC minimum guideline.

### Improvements for Next Iteration

- Consider adding Scenario Outlines with Examples tables for the character limit boundary tests (consolidate 3 boundary tests into 1 parameterized test)
- Add accessibility-specific test scenarios (screen reader behavior during AI parsing preview updates)
- Add mobile-specific scenarios (touch input behavior, mobile keyboard interaction)

### Lessons for Future Test Generation

- US-01's acceptance criteria were well-structured with Gherkin format, making extraction straightforward
- The "open questions" in the story (multi-task detection, character limit) provided good material for boundary and edge case tests
- AI service failure modes (timeout, rate limit, HTTP 500, malformed response, null response) are a rich source of negative and edge case tests for any AI-dependent feature
