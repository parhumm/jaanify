## Per-Domain Executive Summary

### Dev — 6.1/10

Light-mode engineering audit of Jaanify MVP scaffold outputs across backend (Fastify v5 + Prisma v6 + Zod) and frontend (React 19 + Next.js 15 + TailwindCSS v4). The scaffold demonstrates strong framework pattern adherence (RFC 9457 errors, React 19 patterns, TailwindCSS v4 CSS-first config) but contains **1 critical security finding** (JWT decode without signature verification), **2 high findings** (no rate limiting, localStorage token storage), and **3 medium findings** (untyped response formatters, missing CSRF protection, no Content Security Policy). Score of 6.1/10 reflects scaffold code with TODO stubs, not production-ready code.

### Design — not analyzed

No detect-design output available. Run `/jaan-to:detect-design` to analyze design system patterns, token consistency, and component drift.

### Writing — not analyzed

No detect-writing output available. Run `/jaan-to:detect-writing` to extract writing system, glossary, UI copy patterns, and localization maturity.

### Product — not analyzed

No detect-product output available. Run `/jaan-to:detect-product` to extract product features, value propositions, monetization, and metrics.

### UX — not analyzed

No detect-ux output available. Run `/jaan-to:detect-ux` to audit user journeys, personas, heuristics, and accessibility gaps.

## Top Findings (from Dev domain)

| # | ID | Severity | Finding | Remediation |
|---|-----|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | E-DEV-001 | Critical | JWT decode without signature verification | Replace `decodeJwt` with `@fastify/jwt` or `jose` |
| 2 | E-DEV-003 | High | Access token stored in localStorage | Move to httpOnly cookies or in-memory only |
| 3 | E-DEV-002 | High | No rate limiting configured | Add `@fastify/rate-limit` |
| 4 | E-DEV-005 | Medium | Missing CSRF protection | Set `SameSite=Strict` on auth cookies |
| 5 | E-DEV-004 | Medium | Response formatters use `Record<string, unknown>` | Type with Prisma generated types |

## Score Calculation

```
overall_score = 10 - (critical × 2.0 + high × 1.0 + medium × 0.4 + low × 0.1) / max(total_findings, 1)
             = 10 - (1×2.0 + 2×1.0 + 3×0.4 + 3×0.1) / max(11, 1)
             = 10 - (2.0 + 2.0 + 1.2 + 0.3) / 11
             = 10 - 5.5 / 11
             = 10 - 0.5
             = 6.1 (partial — 1/5 domains)
```

> **Note**: This score is based on engineering (dev) findings only. A complete analysis across all 5 domains would provide a more representative overall score. The score is a summary metric, not a final quality judgment.

## Next Steps

Run the remaining detect skills to complete the knowledge pack:

1. `/jaan-to:detect-design` — Design system detection
2. `/jaan-to:detect-writing` — Writing system extraction
3. `/jaan-to:detect-product` — Product reality extraction
4. `/jaan-to:detect-ux` — UX audit

Then re-run `/jaan-to:detect-pack` to consolidate all domains.

Run with `--full` for evidence index (source map), unknowns backlog with confirmation steps, cross-platform finding deduplication, and per-platform detail packs.
