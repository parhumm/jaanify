# Jaanify MVP — Knowledge Pack Summary

> Coverage: **5/5 domains** (100%)
> Score: **6.4/10**

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Mode** | Single-Platform |
| **Platform** | all |
| **Domains Analyzed** | 5/5 (dev, design, writing, product, ux) |
| **Total Findings** | 34 |
| **Overall Score** | 6.4/10 (domain-weighted average) |
| **Target Commits** | Multiple (see Input Mode Table) |

> **Stale Warning**: All domain outputs were generated at commits prior to current HEAD (`901f4be`). The dev summary is 1 commit behind; design, writing, product, and ux are from 2026-02-10. Findings remain valid as they analyze the same scaffold output set.

## Risk Heatmap

| Domain | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info | Score |
|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|------|-------|
| Dev | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 9.9 |
| Design | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 6.5 |
| Writing | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 5.0 |
| Product | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4.5 |
| UX | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 6.0 |
| **Total** | **1** | **3** | **10** | **9** | **11** | **6.4** |

### Risk Distribution

- **Critical (1)**: No monetization path (product) — launch blocker
- **High (3)**: Zero i18n infrastructure (writing), all 21 service handlers are TODO stubs (product), auth routing hardcoded to /onboarding (ux)
- **Medium (10)**: Missing lock file, test configs, hardcoded dev secrets (dev); tokens in string export, components in single file (design); microcopy specs disconnected from code (writing); analytics not wired, feature flags not runtime-toggleable (product); missing `/tasks/new` page, no settings page (ux)
- **Low (9)**: Missing ESLint for API, no root Prettier, React Compiler experimental (dev); hardcoded hex theme color, no Storybook (design); localStorage token pattern, no content linting (writing); no landing page (product); no breadcrumb/back navigation (ux)
- **Informational (11)**: Positive signals — Turborepo task graph, pnpm workspaces, Fastify plugins, TypeScript strict, Zod type provider, Prisma fullTextSearch (dev); missing breakpoint/z-index tokens (design); RFC 9457 error format (writing); well-defined success metrics (product); skip link, server-side prefetching (ux)

## Per-Domain Executive Summary

### Dev — 9.9/10

Turborepo + pnpm monorepo with Fastify v5 + Prisma v6 backend and Next.js 15 + React 19 frontend. Docker multi-stage builds with security hardening (non-root users, healthchecks, alpine images). Light mode (Layers 1-2 only): 3 medium findings (missing pnpm lock file, absent test configs, hardcoded dev secrets in docker-compose) and 3 low. No critical or high issues at config/container layer. Score reflects config manifests only — run `--full` for code-level security audit.

### Design — 6.5/10

37 design tokens across 6 categories using oklch color space with full dark mode support. 26 React 19 components across 5 atomic design levels with consistent variant/size patterns. Entire system exists in scaffold form only — tokens embedded in config.ts string export, all components bundled in single .tsx file. No Storybook stories or visual regression testing.

### Writing — 5.0/10

~55 user-facing strings with consistent friendly/encouraging tone matching PRD spec. RFC 9457 error format on backend. i18n maturity is Level 0: zero locale files, no i18n library installed, all strings hardcoded inline. 7-language microcopy specifications exist as deliverables but are disconnected from code.

### Product — 4.5/10

21 backend API endpoints across 7 domains and 3 frontend pages fully specified as scaffold. Zero monetization path — no billing code, no pricing page, no tier enforcement (critical). All service handlers return TODO stubs (high). Analytics specified (PostHog env vars, 18 GTM events) but zero tracking code implemented. Lowest-scoring domain.

### UX — 6.0/10

4 routes with 4 user flows. Strong UX patterns: 4-step progressive commitment onboarding targeting <60s first-task, server-side data prefetching, 44px minimum touch targets, reduced motion support, skip link. Key gaps: auth routing is hardcoded redirect to `/onboarding` (TODO stub), `/tasks/new` route referenced but not scaffolded, no settings or profile pages.

## Score Calculation

**Domain-weighted average** (equal weight per domain, used as reported score):

```
(9.9 + 6.5 + 5.0 + 4.5 + 6.0) / 5 = 31.9 / 5 = 6.38 ≈ 6.4/10
```

**Formula-based aggregate** (per detect-pack specification):

```
overall_score = 10 - (C×2.0 + H×1.0 + M×0.4 + L×0.1) / max(total, 1)
             = 10 - (1×2.0 + 3×1.0 + 10×0.4 + 9×0.1) / 34
             = 10 - (2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 0.9) / 34
             = 10 - 0.29
             = 9.71
```

> **Note**: The formula-based score (9.71) is inflated because 64% of findings are low/informational severity. The domain-weighted average (6.4) better reflects product readiness. Using domain-weighted average as the reported score.

## Changes Since Previous Pack (PACK-2026-002)

| Metric | Previous (2026-02-10) | Current (2026-02-12) | Delta |
|--------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Overall Score | 5.6/10 | 6.4/10 | +0.8 |
| Dev Score | 6.1 | 9.9 | +3.8 (re-run as light L1-2 only) |
| Critical | 2 | 1 | -1 (JWT finding was in full-mode dev audit) |
| High | 5 | 3 | -2 (rate limiting, localStorage findings in full-mode) |
| Total Findings | 33 | 34 | +1 |

> **Important**: Dev score increase (6.1 → 9.9) is due to the dev audit being re-run in light mode (Layers 1-2: config + container only). The previous audit included code-level security findings (JWT verification, rate limiting, localStorage tokens) that are only visible in `--full` mode. The underlying code has not changed — the scope narrowed.

---

Run with `--full` for evidence index (source map), unknowns backlog with confirmation steps, cross-platform finding deduplication, and per-platform detail packs.
