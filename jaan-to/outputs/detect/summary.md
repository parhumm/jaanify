# Jaanify — Knowledge Pack (Light Mode)

> Generated by jaan.to detect-pack | 2026-02-16
> Platforms: api, web (multi-platform)
> Domains analyzed: 5/5
> Overall score: **7.7/10**
> Previous: PACK-2026-003 (2026-02-12, score 7.2/10, single-platform)

## Overview

- **Mode**: Multi-Platform (Hybrid — dev domain uses legacy 'all' format)
- **Platforms analyzed**: 2 (api, web)
- **Domains analyzed**: 5/5 (dev, design, writing, product, ux)
- **Overall score**: 7.7/10
- **Total findings**: 51 (across all platforms and domains)
- **Input mode**: All domains provided light-mode summaries

## Risk Heatmap

| Domain | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info | Score |
|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|------|-------|
| **Dev** | 0 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 8.1 |
| **Design** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 7.8 |
| **Writing** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 5.5 |
| **Product** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 6.4 |
| **UX** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 10 | 7.0 |
| **Total** | **2** | **6** | **10** | **9** | **24** | **7.7** |

**Hotspots**: Product domain has the only Critical findings (missing monetization). Writing domain has the lowest score (5.5) due to zero i18n infrastructure.

### Platform Scores

| Platform | Dev | Design | Writing | Product | UX | Overall |
|----------|-----|--------|---------|---------|-----|---------|
| **api** | 8.1* | 10.0 | 10.0 | 6.5 | 8.0 | 8.5 |
| **web** | 8.1* | 7.8 | 5.5 | 6.2 | 7.0 | 6.9 |

\* Dev score shared (legacy single-platform format)

## Per-Domain Executive Summaries

### Dev -- 8.1/10

Turborepo + pnpm monorepo with Fastify v5 + Prisma v6 (Railway) and Next.js 15 + React 19 (Vercel), both live in production. Strong security posture: multi-stage Docker, SHA-pinned Actions (38/39), comprehensive Fastify security middleware. Primary concern: widespread `continue-on-error: true` in CI/CD masks security and deployment failures.

### Design -- 7.8/10 (web) | 10.0/10 (api: N/A)

Web platform has a well-structured design system on TailwindCSS v4 with 25 custom `@theme` tokens (OKLCH color space), 23-component atomic design library, and excellent token discipline (zero arbitrary Tailwind values). Full dark mode via next-themes. Gaps: no Storybook, incomplete typography scale, missing breakpoint tokens. API has no UI — not applicable.

### Writing -- 5.5/10 (web) | 10.0/10 (api: N/A)

Web has ~120 user-facing strings with consistent friendly-casual voice (NNg tone analysis: slightly playful, casual, respectful, enthusiastic). i18n maturity is Level 0 — no i18n library, no locale files, all strings hardcoded inline across 33 components. 7-language microcopy specs exist as deliverables but are disconnected from code. API uses RFC 9457 structured errors — no UI copy.

### Product -- 6.4/10 (avg: api 6.5, web 6.2)

16 API endpoints across 6 domains, 4 web pages. Core differentiators: AI-powered task parsing (OpenAI), daily plan generation, 3-tier reasoning transparency cards. Guest sessions enable try-before-signup. **Critical gap**: zero monetization — no billing, no tiers, no entitlement gates across either platform. **High gap**: zero analytics instrumentation.

### UX -- 7.0/10 (web) | 8.0/10 (api)

Web: strong accessibility (skip links, prefers-reduced-motion on all 19 animated components, comprehensive ARIA, focus management in onboarding). Clear 4-route user flow with progressive disclosure. Gaps: no error.tsx boundaries, no loading.tsx streaming fallbacks, missing focus styles on "Skip for now" button. API: RFC 9457 errors with field-level pointers, tiered rate limiting with informative headers, structured feedback collection.

## Top Cross-Platform Findings

### 1. No Monetization (Critical) -- api + web

Evidence: `E-PRD-API-001`, `E-PRD-WEB-001`

No billing integration, no pricing page, no tier enforcement, no payment endpoints on either platform. Revenue generation requires full billing infrastructure buildout.

### 2. No Analytics (High) -- api + web

Evidence: `E-PRD-API-002`, `E-PRD-WEB-002`

No PostHog, Mixpanel, GA4, or any analytics SDK despite `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` in .env.example. Product usage, retention, and feature adoption are invisible.

### 3. CI/CD Failure Masking (High) -- all

Evidence: `E-DEV-001`, `E-DEV-002`

`continue-on-error: true` on CD smoke tests, CI security scans (pnpm audit, Trivy), and DB migrations. Security vulnerabilities and broken deployments pass pipeline without alerting.

### 4. Zero i18n Infrastructure (High) -- web

Evidence: `E-WRT-WEB-001`

No i18n library installed, no locale files, all ~120 strings hardcoded inline. 7-language microcopy specs exist but aren't wired to code.

## Changes Since Previous Pack (PACK-2026-003)

| Metric | Previous (2026-02-12) | Current (2026-02-16) | Delta |
|--------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Platform mode | Single (all) | Multi (api, web) | Improved |
| Domains analyzed | 5/5 | 5/5 | Same |
| Overall score | 7.2 | 7.7 | +0.5 |
| Critical findings | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| High findings | 4 | 6 | +2 |
| Total findings | ~35 | 51 | +16 |
| Dev score | 9.9 | 8.1 | -1.8 (deeper CI/CD scan) |
| Design score | 7.5 | 7.8 | +0.3 |
| Writing score | 5.0 | 5.5 | +0.5 |
| Product score | 5.5 | 6.4 | +0.9 |
| UX score | 7.0 | 7.0 | 0.0 |

> **Key changes**: Platform split provides more granular per-platform scoring. Dev score dropped due to CI/CD findings (not scanned previously). Product and writing scores improved with deeper analysis. Overall score up due to better methodology.
