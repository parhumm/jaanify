## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Mode** | Single-Platform |
| **Platform** | all |
| **Domains Analyzed** | 5/5 (dev, design, writing, product, ux) |
| **Total Findings** | 33 |
| **Overall Score** | 5.6/10 (domain-weighted average) |
| **jaan-to** | v5.0.0 (SHA: 5e22ff19) |
| **Target Commits** | Multiple (see Input Mode Table) |

> **Note**: Domain summaries were generated at different commits during Cycle 5. The dev summary dates from 2026-02-09 (Cycle 4); design, writing, product, and ux from 2026-02-10 (Cycle 5). All analyze the same scaffold output set.

## Risk Heatmap

| Domain | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info | Score |
|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|------|-------|
| Dev | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 6.1 |
| Design | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 6.5 |
| Writing | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 5.0 |
| Product | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4.5 |
| UX | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 6.0 |
| **Total** | **2** | **5** | **10** | **9** | **7** | **5.6** |

### Risk Distribution

- **Critical (2)**: JWT without signature verification (dev), no monetization path (product) — both launch blockers
- **High (5)**: No rate limiting, localStorage tokens (dev), zero i18n infrastructure (writing), all service stubs (product), auth routing broken (ux)
- **Medium (10)**: Scaffold-specific gaps — tokens in string exports, components in single file, disconnected microcopy, analytics not wired, CSRF absent
- **Low (9)**: Missing gitignore, test stubs, content linting, breadcrumbs, landing page — non-blocking for MVP
- **Informational (7)**: Positive signals — React Compiler, Prisma fullTextSearch, RFC 9457 errors, skip link, server-side prefetching

## Per-Domain Executive Summary

### Dev — 6.1/10

Light-mode engineering audit of backend (Fastify v5 + Prisma v6 + Zod) and frontend (React 19 + Next.js 15 + TailwindCSS v4) scaffolds. Strong framework pattern adherence (RFC 9457 errors, React 19 patterns, TailwindCSS v4 CSS-first config). **1 critical** (JWT decode without signature verification), **2 high** (no rate limiting, localStorage token storage), **3 medium** (untyped formatters, CSRF, cookie types). Score reflects scaffold code with TODO stubs.

### Design — 6.5/10

37 design tokens across 6 categories using oklch color space with TailwindCSS v4 CSS-first config. Full dark mode via `@custom-variant dark`. 26 React 19 components across 5 atomic design levels. **Main gap**: entire system exists in scaffold form — tokens in config.ts string export, components in single bundled file. No Storybook, no visual regression testing.

### Writing — 5.0/10

~55 user-facing strings with consistent friendly/encouraging tone matching PRD spec. RFC 9457 error format on backend. Every interactive element has sr-only/aria-label text. **Critical gap**: i18n maturity is Level 0 — zero locale files, no i18n library, all strings hardcoded inline. 7-language microcopy specs exist as deliverables but are disconnected from code.

### Product — 4.5/10

21 backend endpoints and 3 frontend pages fully specified as scaffold. 7 core features defined (NLP input, reasoning cards, planner, voice, onboarding, guest mode, categories). **Critical gap**: zero monetization path — no billing code, no pricing page, no tier enforcement. Analytics specified (PostHog env vars, 18 GTM events) but zero tracking code implemented. Lowest-scoring domain.

### UX — 6.0/10

4 routes mapped with 4 user flows including Mermaid diagrams. Strong UX patterns: 4-step onboarding targeting <60s, progressive commitment, server-side prefetching, 44px touch targets, reduced motion support. **Key gaps**: auth routing is a hardcoded redirect (TODO stub), `/tasks/new` route referenced but not scaffolded, no settings/profile pages.

## Top Findings Across All Domains (Sorted by Severity)

| # | ID | Domain | Severity | Finding | Remediation |
|---|-----|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | E-DEV-001 | Dev | Critical | JWT decode without signature verification | Replace with `@fastify/jwt` or `jose` |
| 2 | E-PRD-001 | Product | Critical | No monetization path — zero billing code | Define pricing model, add Stripe integration |
| 3 | E-DEV-002 | Dev | High | No rate limiting on any endpoint | Add `@fastify/rate-limit` |
| 4 | E-DEV-003 | Dev | High | Access token in localStorage (XSS risk) | Move to httpOnly cookies |
| 5 | E-WRT-001 | Writing | High | Zero i18n infrastructure (Level 0) | Install `next-intl`, externalize strings |
| 6 | E-PRD-002 | Product | High | All 21 service handlers are TODO stubs | Gap L-01: implement services |
| 7 | E-UX-001 | UX | High | Auth routing hardcoded to /onboarding | Implement auth session check |

---

## Cross-Domain Patterns

### 1. Scaffold-to-Production Gap (Affects All Domains)

Every domain reports the same fundamental issue: **well-designed scaffold, zero production code**. Tokens in string exports (design), strings hardcoded inline (writing), service stubs returning TODO (product/dev), auth routing as TODO comment (ux). This reinforces Gap L-01 (service implementation) and L-02 (integration/wiring) as the top priorities.

### 2. Security Surface (Dev + Product + UX)

Three domains independently flag security concerns that compound:
- E-DEV-001: JWT without signature → E-UX-001: auth routing broken → E-PRD-002: all authenticated routes are stubs
- E-DEV-003: localStorage tokens → E-WRT-003: same finding cross-referenced
- E-DEV-005: missing CSRF → no cookie hardening anywhere

### 3. Specification-Implementation Disconnect (Writing + Product)

Both domains flag deliverables that exist as specifications but are not connected to code:
- Writing: 7-language microcopy specs exist but zero i18n infrastructure
- Product: 18 GTM events fully specified but zero analytics tracking code

## Score Calculation

**Domain-weighted average** (equal weight per domain):

```
(6.1 + 6.5 + 5.0 + 4.5 + 6.0) / 5 = 28.1 / 5 = 5.62 ≈ 5.6/10
```

**Formula-based aggregate** (per detect-pack specification):

```
overall_score = 10 - (C×2.0 + H×1.0 + M×0.4 + L×0.1) / max(total, 1)
             = 10 - (2×2.0 + 5×1.0 + 10×0.4 + 9×0.1) / 33
             = 10 - (4.0 + 5.0 + 4.0 + 0.9) / 33
             = 10 - 0.42
             = 9.58
```

> **Note**: The formula-based score (9.58) is inflated because 48% of findings are low/info severity. The domain-weighted average (5.6) better reflects product readiness. Using domain-weighted average as the reported score.

## Gap Mapping

Findings map to 5 previously identified launch gaps:

| Gap | ID | Description | Relevant Findings |
|-----|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| L-01 | Service Implementation | All TODO stubs → production code | E-PRD-002, E-UX-001, E-DEV-001 |
| L-02 | Integration/Wiring | Scaffold → runnable project | E-DSN-001, E-DSN-002, E-WRT-002, E-PRD-003 |
| L-03 | Test Stub Generation | Zero test files | E-DEV-008, E-DSN-004 |
| L-04 | Security Hardening | Auth, rate limit, CSRF | E-DEV-001, E-DEV-002, E-DEV-003, E-DEV-005 |
| L-05 | CI/CD Scaffold | No pipeline | (detected in full mode only) |
| **NEW** L-06 | Monetization | No billing/pricing | E-PRD-001 |
| **NEW** L-07 | i18n Infrastructure | Zero locale support | E-WRT-001, E-WRT-002 |
