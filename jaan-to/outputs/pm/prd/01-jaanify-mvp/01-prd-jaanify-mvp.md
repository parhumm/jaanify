# Jaanify MVP — The AI Task Manager That Shows Its Work

> Generated by jaan.to | 2026-02-07

---

## Executive Summary

People don't trust AI task managers because they operate as black boxes — reordering priorities without explanation. Jaanify solves this by making AI reasoning transparent through a 3-tier "Reasoning Card" system, targeting the underserved neurodivergent and freelancer segments with a 60-second onboarding experience. Built as a PWA-first web app with natural language and voice input, Jaanify pioneers a "Transparent Copilot" approach in a $2.2B market where no competitor shows users *why* the AI made its recommendations.

## Problem Statement

People who manage their own work — freelancers, solopreneurs, knowledge workers, and especially those with ADHD — face a paradox with modern task management tools. AI-powered apps promise to optimize their day, but users can't verify whether the AI's suggestions are genuinely helpful or just shuffling tasks around. This creates a trust deficit that leads to:

- **App abandonment**: Productivity apps retain only 9.63% of users by Day 30, largely because users don't trust or understand the AI's decisions
- **Backlog anxiety**: Growing task lists become a source of shame rather than productivity when users can't see why certain tasks are prioritized
- **Neurodivergent exclusion**: Existing tools are either too simple (can't adapt to non-linear thinking) or too complex (trigger decision paralysis) — with zero transparency about how they work
- **Freelancer overwhelm**: 41.8 million US solopreneurs juggle every role without AI tools that understand or explain their full context

The root cause is the same across all segments: **AI that acts without explaining its reasoning erodes trust instead of building it.** Research confirms that 84% of consumers would trust AI more if it demonstrated explainability, yet no task management tool occupies this space.

## Solution Overview

Jaanify is an AI-native task manager built around a core principle: **show your work**. Instead of the industry-standard "Autopilot" (AI decides everything silently) or "Copilot" (AI suggests without explanation), Jaanify introduces a **Transparent Copilot** — where every AI recommendation comes with visible reasoning.

### Core Components

**1. Natural Language Task Input**
Users type or speak tasks naturally ("Buy groceries for dinner tonight, remind me at 4 PM"). Jaanify's AI parses the input in real-time, extracting deadlines, categories, subtasks, and priority — showing the parsing process as it happens.

**2. 3-Tier Reasoning Cards**
Every AI recommendation includes a Reasoning Card with progressive disclosure:
- **Tier 1 — Glanceable (Default):** One-line explanation on every recommendation. Example: *"#1 because: deadline in 2h + blocks 3 tasks"*
- **Tier 2 — Explorable (Tap to expand):** Factor weights with visual bars, confidence level, data sources, and override button
- **Tier 3 — Auditable (Power users):** Full reasoning chain, historical accuracy of similar recommendations, option to adjust AI weighting

**3. AI Daily Planner**
Each morning, Jaanify generates a personalized daily plan with transparent reasoning for the order. Users see why each task landed where it did and can override with feedback that trains the AI.

**4. 60-Second Onboarding**
No account required for the first interaction. App opens to a single input: "What's on your mind?" User creates their first AI-enriched task in under 30 seconds. Account creation is deferred until after the first value moment.

**5. Voice Capture (Multimodal)**
Tap mic → speak naturally → AI transcribes + parses in parallel → visual card shows enriched result → save. Total time: 8-12 seconds for a complete task with metadata.

## User Stories

### US-01: Natural Language Task Creation
**As a** freelancer juggling multiple clients,
**I want to** type "Call Sarah about the Johnson proposal by Friday 2 PM" and have Jaanify automatically extract the task, deadline, and context,
**so that** I can capture tasks in my natural thought flow without switching to a structured form.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- NLP extracts: title, deadline, category (auto-detected), priority (auto-suggested)
- AI parsing preview appears in real-time as user types (Fastify REST endpoint, <100ms p95)
- User can edit any parsed field before saving
- Reasoning Card shows parsing logic: "Detected deadline: Friday 2 PM | Category: Client work (keyword: proposal)"

### US-02: Transparent AI Daily Plan
**As a** knowledge worker with ADHD,
**I want to** see my daily plan with clear reasons why each task is ordered the way it is,
**so that** I can trust the AI's suggestions and feel confident about what to work on next.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Daily plan generated each morning (or on demand) via AI (OpenAI SDK, <3s response)
- Each task slot includes a Tier 1 Reasoning Card (one-line explanation)
- Tapping a reasoning card expands to Tier 2 (factor weights, confidence level)
- User can override any recommendation and provide feedback ("Not now because..." with options)
- Override feedback is stored and improves future recommendations
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (Socket.io v4, <500ms sync)

### US-03: Voice Task Capture
**As a** solopreneur on the go,
**I want to** tap a microphone button and speak my task naturally,
**so that** I can capture ideas and to-dos without typing on a small screen.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Microphone button accessible from any screen (FAB or persistent UI element)
- Web Speech API transcribes in real-time with visual waveform feedback
- AI parses spoken input in parallel with transcription
- Visual confirmation card shows enriched task (title, deadline, category, subtasks)
- User can edit or save with one tap (or say "Save" / "Done")
- Total flow completes in 8-12 seconds
- Graceful fallback if microphone access denied: show text input with hint

### US-04: 60-Second Onboarding
**As a** first-time user,
**I want to** create my first AI-enriched task without creating an account first,
**so that** I can experience Jaanify's value before committing to sign up.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- App opens to a single input field: "What's on your mind?" (no splash screen, no tutorial)
- First task created and AI-enriched within 30 seconds of app open
- Reasoning Card shown on the first task demonstrates AI transparency
- Account creation prompt appears only after first task is saved (soft prompt, not blocking)
- Guest session persists for 7 days (localStorage + optional anonymous Supabase session)
- Page LCP <2s per tech.md performance requirements

### US-05: Reasoning Card Drill-Down
**As a** user who wants to understand AI decisions,
**I want to** tap on any AI recommendation's reasoning and see progressively more detail,
**so that** I can build trust in the AI and learn how it makes decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Tier 1 (Glanceable):** One-line summary visible by default on every AI recommendation
- **Tier 2 (Explorable):** Tap expands to show factor weights (visual bars), confidence percentage, data points used, and "Override" button
- **Tier 3 (Auditable):** Long-press or "See full reasoning" shows complete reasoning chain, historical accuracy for similar recommendations, and "Adjust weights" option
- Smooth animation between tiers (Next.js transitions, TailwindCSS)
- Tier preference persisted per user (Zustand state + localStorage)

### US-06: Task Prioritization with Visible Factors
**As a** user reviewing my task list,
**I want to** see what factors the AI considered when prioritizing each task,
**so that** I can validate the AI's reasoning and adjust priorities when the AI's context is incomplete.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each task in list view shows priority rank with Tier 1 reasoning
- Priority factors include: deadline proximity, user-set importance, dependencies, estimated energy level, time of day fit, historical completion patterns
- Factor weights shown as visual bars in Tier 2 view
- User can manually override priority with optional reason (stored for AI learning)
- Re-prioritization happens in <3s when user overrides (OpenAI SDK)

### US-07: Accessibility for Neurodivergent Users
**As a** user with ADHD,
**I want to** use an interface that adapts to my needs — less visual clutter when I'm overwhelmed, more detail when I'm focused,
**so that** the app helps rather than hinders my executive function.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- "Focus Mode" reduces UI to single next task + reasoning card
- Task list supports visual timelines to combat time blindness
- Gentle nudge notifications (opt-in, not opt-out) with warm tone
- Color-coded priority system with high-contrast mode
- All core flows pass WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit
- Keyboard navigation for all task operations
- Screen reader support for Reasoning Cards
