## Scores (1-5)

- **Output Quality**: 4 - Roadmap created with all 6 phases as tasks. Clear structure.
- **Doc Compliance**: 4 - roadmap.md created at correct path, committed.
- **Template System**: 3 - Roadmap format is simpler than other skills (no template file used). Phase structure is ad-hoc.
- **Learning Integration**: 3 - Learn file was empty (first run).
- **v3.0.0 Compliance**: 4 - Correct path in jaan-to/ workspace.

## Issues Found

- Skill is designed for single task addition but was used to batch-add entire project roadmap. Worked but was awkward.
- No duplication check feedback for bulk additions.

## Suggested Improvements

- Add bulk task mode: accept a list of tasks to add at once.
- Show phase summary after adding (task counts per phase).
