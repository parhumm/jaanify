# Scorecard: dev-verify

> Tested: 2026-02-21 | jaan-to v7.2.0-1-g3c10276 (SHA: 3c10276) | Cycle 14

## Score: 4.5 / 5.0

| Dimension | Weight | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 30% | 5/5 | Found and fixed both build errors: TS2345 response schema mismatch + Next.js Suspense boundary. Build passes cleanly. |
| Output Quality | 25% | 4.5/5 | Clean verification report with before/after error counts, categorized fixes, route output table. |
| Context Awareness | 20% | 4.5/5 | Correctly identified Fastify type provider constraint and Next.js 15 SSG requirement. Cross-referenced integrated files. |
| Learning Integration | 15% | 4/5 | HARD STOP respected. Learn file not found (expected). Manual execution needed due to disable-model-invocation flag. |
| Workflow Efficiency | 10% | 4/5 | Efficient 2-pass fix cycle (type check → build). Only 2 iterations needed vs 8 in C11. |

## Strengths

1. **Fast error resolution** — 2 errors found and fixed in 2 iterations (vs 8 iterations in C11)
2. **Correct categorization** — `type-mismatch` and `config-mismatch` both auto-fixed properly
3. **Clean build output** — All 6 routes statically generated, `/login` at 3.3 kB First Load JS
4. **Non-destructive fixes** — Added schema and Suspense boundary without changing behavior

## Issues

1. **Skill unavailable via Skill tool** — `disable-model-invocation: true` required manual execution (same as C11)
2. **No runtime verification** — Build-only mode (no services running)
3. **No integration manifest** — `.last-integration-manifest` still not generated by dev-output-integrate

## Gaps Discovered

- `disable-model-invocation: true` continues to prevent normal Skill tool invocation
- Integration manifest gap persists from C11 — dev-output-integrate still doesn't write it
- Node.js v18 locally vs v22 in `engines` — non-blocking but should be resolved for production

## History

| Cycle | jaan-to Ver | Score | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| 11 | v6.3.0 | 4.8/5 | First test: 31+ errors → 0, both apps build |
| 14 | v7.2.0 | 4.5/5 | Retest: 2 errors → 0, login/auth build verified, fast resolution |
