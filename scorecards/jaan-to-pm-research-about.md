# jaan-to-pm-research-about Scorecard

Run: 2026-02-07 | Cycle: 1 | jaan-to Version: v3.15.2 | New/Existing: First use

## Scores (1-5)

- **Output Quality**: 4 - Comprehensive market research with competitors, pain points, opportunities. Good depth across waves.
- **Doc Compliance**: 5 - Output matched template structure, README index updated, git committed per spec.
- **Template System**: 4 - Template variables resolved correctly. Adaptive 5-wave approach worked well.
- **Learning Integration**: 3 - Learn file was empty (first run). No prior lessons to apply.
- **v3.0.0 Compliance**: 4 - Used sequential ID (01-), correct paths, env vars. Minor: research files use NN- prefix not ID-slug format.

## Issues Found

- Research file naming uses `01-pm-ai-task-management-market.md` (flat NN-prefix) rather than subfolder pattern `01-slug/01-research-slug.md` used by other skills.
- Adaptive wave approach is powerful but hard to steer — no way to focus waves on specific subtopics mid-execution.

## Suggested Improvements

- Align research output structure with other skills (ID-based subfolder pattern).
- Allow wave focus override between waves for more targeted research.
