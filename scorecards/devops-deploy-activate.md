## Score: 4.2 / 5.0

| Dimension | Weight | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 30% | 4/5 | CI fully green (5/5 jobs). CD blocked by expired Railway token (user issue) and Vercel monorepo framework detection (required manual iteration) |
| Output Quality | 25% | 4/5 | Activation report comprehensive. Multiple CD iterations documented clearly |
| Context Awareness | 20% | 4/5 | Correctly detected all secrets/variables as configured. Did not detect ESLint config gap or Vitest e2e inclusion |
| Learning Integration | 15% | 5/5 | Applied L-13, L-14, L-16, L-19 fixes from v6.3.0. Health check + rotation workflows now generated by infra-scaffold |
| Workflow Efficiency | 10% | 4/5 | CI fixes took 3 pushes (lint → web tests → web typecheck). Vercel took 4 iterations |

## Strengths

1. All previous gaps (L-13, L-14, L-16, L-19) addressed by v6.3.0 — health monitoring, secret rotation, pnpm fix, repo variables
2. CI pipeline went from 3 failing jobs to fully green in one session
3. SHA pinning from Cycle 10 remained intact — no regression
4. Migration step successfully ran against Supabase (DB woke from pause)
5. Docker image build + push to ghcr.io works correctly

## Issues

1. **ESLint config not scaffolded**: API package had no `eslint.config.js` — the `dev-output-integrate` or `backend-scaffold` skill should have generated this
2. **Vitest/e2e collision not detected**: Web app's Vitest picked up Playwright specs — infra-scaffold should generate vitest.config.ts with e2e exclusion when both Vitest and Playwright are in the stack
3. **Vercel monorepo detection**: Framework detection fails in monorepo root — skill should handle this pattern (move vercel.json to app directory or set `framework: null`)
4. **Railway token validation**: Skill should validate token via `railway whoami` before attempting deploy, with clear error message on failure
5. **Multiple CD iterations**: Took 4 push-and-fix cycles to converge on correct Vercel config — skill should validate deployment config locally before pushing

## Gaps Discovered

- **New**: Backend-scaffold should generate `eslint.config.js` for ESLint 9 flat config
- **New**: Infra-scaffold should generate per-workspace `vitest.config.ts` when e2e tests detected
- **New**: Deploy-activate should validate Vercel monorepo config (Root Directory, framework detection) before triggering deployment
- **Carried**: No "dry run" mode for deployment validation

## History

| Cycle | jaan-to Ver | Score | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| 9 | v6.1.0 | 4.0/5 | First test: SHA pinning done, platform provisioning blocked by missing CLIs |
| 10 | v6.1.1 | 4.3/5 | Full activation. Health/rotation workflows manual (3 new gaps) |
| 11 | v6.3.0 | 4.2/5 | CI green, CD requires iteration. ESLint/Vitest gaps discovered. v6.3.0 fixes applied |
