# jaan-to-ux-research-synthesize Scorecard

Run: 2026-02-07 | Cycle: 2 | jaan-to Version: v3.16.3 | New/Existing: First use

## Scores (1-5)

- **Output Quality**: 5 - 6 themed findings with evidence from 32 sources, INSIGHT/SO WHAT/NOW WHAT recommendations, Nielsen severity ratings, Impact/Effort quadrants, and success metrics. Both synthesis report and executive brief are standalone-readable.
- **Doc Compliance**: 5 - Correct folder structure (01-jaanify-market-research/), two output files (synthesis + exec brief), README index.
- **Template System**: 5 - All template sections filled. Executive brief is concise (<400 words), methodology note includes limitations.
- **Learning Integration**: 4 - Learn file applied: small sample language guidelines, contradictory findings framework, 3-8 theme sweet spot (6 themes produced).
- **v3.0.0 Compliance**: 5 - ID-based folders, sequential numbering, index updater.

## Issues Found

- Skill is designed for primary research (interview transcripts) but was adapted for secondary market research (published sources). The "participant coverage" workflow doesn't map cleanly — sources replaced participants.
- Codebook step (Step 5) was less relevant for secondary research since there are no verbatim interview quotes — adapted to source citation extraction instead.

## Suggested Improvements

- Add explicit "secondary research mode" to the mode selection (Speed/Standard/Cross-Study) — currently only primary research modes exist.
- Allow source weighting (tier-1 academic vs tier-3 blog) in the confidence calculation.
- Auto-extract source bibliography in standard academic format.
