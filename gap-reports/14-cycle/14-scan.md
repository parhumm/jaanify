## Impact on Existing Artifacts

The login/auth scaffolds from C13 are the primary integration targets:

### Frontend Scaffolds (6 files in `jaan-to/outputs/frontend/scaffold/02-login-auth/`)
- `02-login-page.tsx` → `apps/web/src/app/login/page.tsx`
- `02-middleware.ts` → `apps/web/middleware.ts`
- `02-auth-store.ts` → `apps/web/src/stores/auth-store.ts`
- `02-navbar-auth.tsx` → `apps/web/src/components/organisms/NavbarAuth.tsx`
- `02-landing-page-updates.tsx` → updates to existing landing page
- `02-api-client-updates.ts` → updates to existing API client

### Backend Scaffolds (1 file in `jaan-to/outputs/backend/scaffold/02-login-auth/`)
- `02-login-auth-scaffold.ts` → cookie wrappers + auth route modifications

- `git diff --name-only HEAD` → only `vendor/jaan-to` (submodule pointer change)
- No secrets detected in changed files
