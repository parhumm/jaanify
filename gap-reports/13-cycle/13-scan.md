## New Skills to Test This Cycle

| Skill | Version Added | Category | Relevance to Jaanify |
|-------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| `team-ship` | v7.1.0 | Core / Orchestration | **HIGH** — User explicitly requested for login/auth fix |

---

## Impact on Existing Artifacts

| Artifact | Impact | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| All 44 SKILL.md files | Added Agent Skills compliance sections | No action — backwards compatible |
| pm-prd-write | Improved readability + RTL | No re-run needed — existing PRD is sufficient |
| Security scripts | New enforcement | Beneficial — will be used by devops skills |
| Hook definitions | New hooks.json | Automatically applied by team-ship |

## Cumulative Skill Coverage

| Status | Count | Skills |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Tested (scorecard exists)** | 42 | All core skills — see scorecards/ directory |

## Cycle 13 Focus

**User-reported P0**: "I can't find login and use" — frontend investigation confirmed:
- No login page (`/login`, `/signin`, `/auth` — none exist)
- No login button on landing page
- Google OAuth = TODO comment
- Dashboard accessible without auth
- No session management UI

**Primary skill**: `team-ship --track fast` to orchestrate multi-role fix
